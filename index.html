    	<h1>Jacob Bowder</h1>
    		<p>I'm a motivated and young graphic designer in Lincoln, NE, who is excited to get his career started. I attended the Graphic Design and Media Arts Program at Southeast Community College in Lincoln. I am a freelance designer who is open to anything he can get his hands on. I'm also a new proud father of a baby boy and can't wait for the fun that comes with have a new young family.</p>
    	<h1>Design Philosophy</h1>
    		<p>My design philosophy can be best described by an analogy my teacher made for me. Would you rather be the designer behind a giant all you can eat buffet? Or would you rather design the $300 dollar plate that is so meticulously designed with only a few portions on it? I feel as though my best design is the design that focuses on the small details. That is what I try to emulate in most of my design, while also trying to break the stride and break the rules every once in a while.</p>
