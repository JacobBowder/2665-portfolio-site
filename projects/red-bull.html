	<h1>Red Bull</h1>
    <h2>Rebrand</h2>
    	<p>This project was used for a re-branding of a famous company. Considerations were taken when targeting the audience of 18-21 year olds. Taking notes from their famous tag line, “It Gives You Wings,” the logo became more of a seal with feathered wings coming from the prominent Red Bull in the center of the logo. </p>
